# Kontakas - AWS Lambda Hackathon
## 3-Minute Demo Presentation

---

## Slide 1: Opening
### Kontakas - Production-Ready Serverless Contact Forms

A production-ready, serverless contact form processing system that demonstrates the true power of AWS Lambda.

I'll show you how Lambda transforms a simple contact form into a scalable, secure, and intelligent business solution that processes thousands of submissions **without managing a single server.**

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
### Traditional Contact Forms Have Issues

- 🔥 **Servers crash under load**
- 🔓 **Security vulnerabilities from spam & bots**  
- 🛠️ **Complex infrastructure management**
- 💰 **High costs for simple functionality**

## Slide 3: The Solution
### AWS Lambda Event-Driven Architecture

**Kontakas solves this with AWS Lambda's event-driven architecture.**

When a user submits a form → API Gateway triggers our Lambda function instantly
- **No servers, no idle time, no crashes** 
- **Just pure serverless efficiency**

---

## Slide 4: Live Demo
### The Magic in Action

**Starting local development environment:**
```bash
./etc/start-dev.sh
```

**Form Submission Demo:**
- Name: "Doe from AWS Hackathon"
- Email: "doe@example.com"  
- Message: "This Lambda demo is amazing!"

**Watch what happens behind the scenes:**
1. **API Gateway** routes request to Lambda
2. **Lambda validates** data using Yup schemas  
3. **reCAPTCHA integration** blocks bots automatically
4. **Multi-tenant architecture** handles organizations
5. **Trigger procedures** Log message/SES send email
6. **CloudWatch logging** captures everything

## Slide 5: Lambda Features
### What Makes This Special

**🏗️ Infrastructure as Code**
- SAM template defines everything
- Lambda functions, API Gateway, S3, CloudFront
- All deployed with one command

**⚡ Cold Start Optimization**  
- esbuild bundling & tree-shaking
- Function starts in under 100ms

**🔧 Environment-Aware Configuration**
